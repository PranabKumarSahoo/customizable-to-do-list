## Inspiration
This is the first Hackathon in my life where I had implemented my development skills. 
So I used to create a webapp using html, css & js which will be used in our daily life i.e. **To-do-list**.
P.S: Many people forget the things they have to do . The to do list will remind them of that things.
## What it does
This project allows you to create a customizable to-do list that is organized into categories. The list is saved in your browser's local storage, so it won't be lost when you reload the page.

However, clearing your browser's data will also delete the saved to-do list. To make the most of this project, it is recommended to use it with a browser extension that changes the new tab page.
## How I built it
I built it using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
## Challenges I ran into
In functionality part i.e. JavaScript I face some difficulties and I preferred out sources, But whatever I completed this.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
To-do-list  is a common projects I know but as a beginner at least I tried something new for me.
## What I learned
I learned all-round deep concepts of HTML, CSS & JavaScript including events, animations, local storage, functionality, OOPs etc. 
And one more lesion that _How little we know, and how much we need to know._
## What's next for To-do-list
Looking to upgrade that there must be a login system that user can login his/her personal account with this and save/continue their personal data whenever they want.
Login Features (use APIs) & Database: So the website can be opened on any device, users can log in, and the To-Dos can be viewed anywhere, anytime.
